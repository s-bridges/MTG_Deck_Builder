# To - Do List

- Allow users to import decks from MTG: Arena
- Allow users to import decks from channel fireball
- Build forum for people to discuss deck 
- Build CSV importer for json file
- Build deck builder 
- Reorganize database to allow for import
- Fix deck route/layout
- And switch out all those references, and then redo a deck table that would have specific information relation to a deck...stuff a user would set. Maybe fields like deck name, description, colors, user_id so you can keep track of who's deck it is on the database
